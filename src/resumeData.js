    "aboutme":"Hi there! My name is Cory, I am a native Texan, and have lived in the beautiful city of Austin since 2002. I moved here for college and fell in love with the culture and the people of Austin. I have worked as a General Manager for a local farm to table restaurant called Odd Duck for the past seven years. During this time, I have grown into a patient and observative group leader, a multi-tasker, and honed my hospitality skills. I feel like I have learned so much from my tenure in the hospitality industry. Like many humans out there, quarantine gave me some time to think. During this period of inner focus, I decided it was time to take on a new adventure. So here I am! I am a student in the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp, and I am excited for what the future has in store for me.",
